Built using Next.js, TypeScript, Framer Motion, and SCSS, this website is a reflection of my passions and interests.

One of the highlights of the website is the drawer that opens and closes with an entertaining spring animation. As you explore, you'll find quotes from my beloved childhood books, "Around the World in Eighty Days" and "Alice in Wonderland", that have left a lasting impression on me.

You'll also come across a brief about me section, where you can learn more about who I am and what drives me. And don't forget to check out the footer, where you'll find links to my social media profiles.
